<h3>Market Rules</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Markets generally open
    <strong>every Friday at midnight Eastern time</strong>, and
    <strong>close on the next Monday at 6am Eastern time</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each market has a correct answer $A \in [10^{-6}, 10^6]$, unless otherwise
    specified. The value of $A$ may be rounded arbitrarily by the game master.
    The precision will not exceed $6$ decimal places.
  </li>
  <li>
    The guess $B$ you submit must be a real number in the interval $[10^{-6},
    10^6]$. Guesses will be rounded to $6$ decimal places. Some markets require
    that $B$ is an integer.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a standard market, if you submit a guess $B$, your score for the market
    (in â™ ) is given by the function \[ w \cdot \left(\min\left\{\frac AB, \frac
    BA\right\}\right)^\alpha \] where $w$ and $\alpha$ are two fixed parameters
    announced for the market. (The default values are $w=4$ and $\alpha=2$.)
    Some markets may have other rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating multiple accounts to OTIS-WEB to circumvent this is forbidden.
    You can change your guess up until the market deadline.
  </li>
  <li>Discussion, collusion, and other antics are permitted.</li>
  <li>
    Participation in markets is available to any one who has been an OTIS
    student or staff member at any point, even if this is no longer the case.
  </li>
