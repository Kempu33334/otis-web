  <h2>Change name and email</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Please use an actual name</strong>.
        Nicknames or other names you go by are OK too,
        as long as you're consistent
        (e.g. if you send me a payment via Paypal/Zelle/Venmo,
        it should be under the same name, otherwise it may get mismatched).
      </p>
      <p>
        But please avoid changing this to a username or other unrecognizable
        string, because it's confusing for Evan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you update your email address,
      it will get subscribed to updates from the OTIS mailing list.
